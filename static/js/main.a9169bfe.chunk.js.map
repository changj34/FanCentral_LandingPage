This can be a die-hard sports fan\n            follows various teams on various platforms or a casual sports fan that only watches once in a while.\n          </h3>\n          <h2>Our Solution:</h2>\n          <h3>To remedy this sports information problem, we conducted research on the most used websites and applications that official sports teams post on and\n            created our own website that pulls posts from different sites, showing them all on one page. To facilitate interaction between fans and teams, we \n            also created a system where every interaction with posts (comments) generates points that can be used to redeem rewards. After our initial prototype and high-fidelity\n            prototype, we sent our product out for user testing and incorporated the feedback into our website.\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n      </header>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
